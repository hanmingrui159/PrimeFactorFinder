# PrimeFactorFinder
INTRODUCTION<br />
-A program that determines whether a number N can be factored into exactly two primes, and if it can be factored, identifies the values of the two factors. <br />
-Used "The Sieve of Eratos" and filtered using unix pipes and processes. <br />
-Exit values indicates the number of filtering processes used during the process<br />

SET-UP <br />
-To compile the program, open bash terminal and cd into the directory containing Makefile and pfact.c, enter "make" command<br />

USAGE<br />
-To run the program, enter command in the format "./pfact n" where n is a positive integer<br />
-The program determines whether the input number is prime, has exactly two primes, and if it can be factored and prints the results<br />
